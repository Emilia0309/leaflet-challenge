Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive map to visualize earthquake data from the USGS. The map will display earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths, providing a clear and informative way to understand earthquake activity around the world.

Features
Interactive Map: A Leaflet map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Data Markers: Markers on the map that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

Popups: Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Legend: A legend that provides context for the map data, explaining the color and size of the markers.
